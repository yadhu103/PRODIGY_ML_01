## Introduction
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I began by thoroughly exploring the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics. This involved analyzing data distributions, identifying outliers, handling missing values, and visualizing key trends. EDA played a crucial role in informing subsequent modeling decisions and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Model Comparison
## Results

After a rigorous comparison, RandomForestRegressor emerged as the most accurate in predicting prices. The performance metrics, such as After Cross-Validation calculated 200 rmse and then found out the mean and std of these rmse's, indicate its superior capability in capturing the underlying patterns in the dataset. This model is selected as the final choice for price prediction in this project.

## Future Steps
## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project marks my initiation into the field of machine learning. Through EDA and model comparison, I have gained valuable insights into the dataset and identified a robust model for predicting prices. This experience serves as a foundation for future projects and continuous learning in the exciting realm of machine learning.
