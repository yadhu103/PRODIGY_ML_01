## Introduction

I began by thoroughly exploring the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics. This involved analyzing data distributions, identifying outliers, handling missing values, and visualizing key trends. EDA played a crucial role in informing subsequent modeling decisions and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Results
Linear regression model is being used in this project to predict the saleprice with a mean and standard deviation of 32302.951288213964 and 22517.159521038953 respectively.
